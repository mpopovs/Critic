<h1> Critic </h1>
<p>
In referring to the recent events in Daugavpils Marka Rothko Art Center, artworks were removed from the exhibition because some people (not related to art) found their content vulgar.
</p>
<p>
The game's main idea is that you need to smash as many "Dicksus Arrogance"   as you can in one minute and save the city from vulgarity.
